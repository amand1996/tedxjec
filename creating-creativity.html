								<h1>Creating Creativity</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="content">
								<p>An unbound imagination is the beginning of all creativity. We are all born with a mind of our own. It could be socially active, an intellectual mind, the wandering or curious mind or more. Our imagination knows no bounds. Humans have gone from starting a fire to creating artificial intelligence supercomputers. Everyone is believed to be an artist in their own capacity so it is necessary to keep the artist in us alive as we grow and hold on to the ability to express our limitless and curious minds. An artist can paint the world with colors or bring out the life in people through teaching or via songs. Not everyone is good at painting or sketching, likewise not everyone will be good at biology or math, and as such everyone is an artist striving in his or her field. It is not about being perfect but about expressing the creativity inside us through the manner we choose best for ourselves.<br>
<br>Just like we are all in some ways imperfect, life is like a bag full of sweets, you may not like everything but you learn something from everything you lay your hands on. We were not born inside any boundary, boundaries were created and to break the wall you cannot wait for an inspiration, you have to chase after it as life does not wait for us; we make it happen as we walk through it, no matter what bumps along the way. We learn to desire from our imagination and thus we can create our own path with our creativity. Being creative does not only involve brainstorming, but it is also about lateral thinking, which involves reasoning that may not be obvious at first and trying to use methods that break from traditional.<br>
<br>
Everything that we do in life, we do, based on an idea that we might have thought before. Sometimes we find a solution to problems by making our own method. Creativity is often synonymous with cleverness, talent and originality but it is not about simply being unique but about making our creativity useful in our lives. Creativity involves thinking of a wide range of ideas, opening up our minds towards new solutions, something different and anything better than what we already have.<br>
<br>Creativity is about taking an initiative, which can be used to reinvent and re-shape the world and ultimately us. Sometimes even doubt can help us lead to more creative thinking, for it is by embracing fear and traversing the unknown and untraveled, can creativity really inspire you and others around you. This is found everywhere such as in the artworks of Andy Warhol to songs by new artists such as Skrillex or Twenty-one pilots to the theories by famous professors.<br>
<br>For us to create such creativity each of us may have our own path of getting there and that is what makes each of us amazing and unique in our own way. Furthermore, we have the ability to work together and cooperate which makes our collective creativity that much greater.
