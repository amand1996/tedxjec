<h3>About TED</h3>
<p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.</p>

<p>The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

<h3>About TEDx, x = independently organized event</h3>
<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)</p>
<h3>About TEDxJECJabalpur</h3>
<p>Ever since the inception of the universe, it has been witness to the beauty of creation and to the varying levels of creativity seen in the universe, both visible and invisible to humans.

With the entry of life into the picture, this cycle received a new audience and a student as well.

We humans have taken inspiration not just from the cosmos but from all that is around us. Be it the simple (rather complicated) amoeba or the farthest corner of the world visible to us. Since time immemorial, the power to create has coursed in our veins for the purpose of making the world around us more beautiful and easier to access.

At TEDxJECJabalpur, we come together to celebrate this gift, not just this, but to share the insight that goes in being what we are best. It is a cornucopia that you will discover, not by what you will see, but by what one will realize. The power to create has been bestowed upon us, and, if you feel like having lost or forgotten it somewhere, this is the place to be!</p>
