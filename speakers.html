								<p>In his own words.... "I began my professional life marching up and down the drill square of the Indian Military Academy as a gentleman cadet and ended my job-era playing hide-&-seek with media teams as the Head of Corporate Communications. A few of the 1800+ poems written by me are published in journals in India & UK but the rest still in notebooks, loose sheets, penned on napkins, and in computer files. I have had short-stories published in anthologies and articles in The Education Post, The Huffington Post, Business Insider, & MarketingBuzzar. I dream of travelling to every country in the world… and of finally completing my first novel." </p>
