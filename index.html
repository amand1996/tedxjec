								<h1>What is TEDx?</h1>
							</header>
							
							<div class="content">
<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDx[name], where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDx[name] event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>

						        <h2>About the speaker</h2>
						        <p>Pavitra Shetty or 'Pavi' as she prefers to be called for reasons of social acceptance is an IT engineer, infrequent gym-goer and burger enthusiast, all redeeming qualities for the average non specific, she just happens to be a girl. The biggest inspirations for her stand-up are her mom, random aunts who keep visiting her place and her very own weighing scale. She juggles her full-time IT job with 200 best friends and still finds humour enough in life to make it to stand-up shows around the city of Mumbai. Pavitra headlines Chalta Hai Comedy's most popular show 'Undateable' and has been featured on TV, podcasts, radio and in print multiple times. She will talk about how humor emerges from an organic process (not the one you think) and how it helps people come to terms with imperfections and the small disappointments of everyday life. </p>

						        <h2>About the speaker</h2>
						        <p>In his own words.... "I began my professional life marching up and down the drill square of the Indian Military Academy as a gentleman cadet and ended my job-era playing hide-&-seek with media teams as the Head of Corporate Communications. A few of the 1800+ poems written by me are published in journals in India & UK but the rest still in notebooks, loose sheets, penned on napkins, and in computer files. I have had short-stories published in anthologies and articles in The Education Post, The Huffington Post, Business Insider, & MarketingBuzzar. I dream of travelling to every country in the world… and of finally completing my first novel." </p>
